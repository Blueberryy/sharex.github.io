## What is OCR?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format.

## How to install more OCR languages?

1. In Windows, open the "Language settings" window. (You can search it by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> key)
2. In "Preferred languages" section, press "Add a language" button.
3. Choose a language that you would like to install, press "Next" button.
4. Uncheck all language features as we don't need any of them for OCR to work, press "Install" button.
5. Wait for Windows to install the language we choose in the background.
6. After language is installed, ShareX will include it in language drop down menu next time OCR window is opened.
